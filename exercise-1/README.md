# TODO List

This week, we're going to create a TODO list app. The first step is to set up the basic html for entering new items and displaying them

1. Create a text input for adding new items to the TODO list
2. When you hit the enter key, a new TODO item should appear on your TODO list, and the text input should be cleared
3. Each TODO item should have a checkbox and a corresponding label

HINT: how should we store our TODO list?
